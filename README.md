SVC and CNN models to try and guess whats inside Christmas presents. There was no sufficient data found online so i made my own data by print screening presents.
The data is not high quality.

For SVC i create my own model but for CNN i use pre trained VGG16 model and freeze its top layers. I found out that this is the best method to gain not terrible results
